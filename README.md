- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin, aspiring Data analyst from Poland
- ğŸ‘€ I graduated from Power enginering with emphasis on computer fluid dynamics.
  During my studies I found it really interesting to learn more about statistics, programming, and optimization.
  That's why one year after self studying I decided to take postgraduated Data science course at AGH in Cracov.
